# Zero-API-Key Web Search

Use this skill when a task needs live search results, source-backed verification, or full-page reading. No API keys required. 100% free.

## Install

```bash
pip install zero-api-key-web-search
```

For Claude Code, the repository also ships `.claude/skills/zero-api-key-web-search/SKILL.md`.
For Manus-style Agent Skills workflows, use this root `SKILL.md` plus [docs/manus.md](docs/manus.md).

## Core Commands

```bash
zero-search "latest Python release" --type news --timelimit w
zero-browse "https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/"
zero-verify "Python 3.13 is the latest stable release" --json
zero-report "Python 3.13 stable release" --claim "Python 3.13 is the latest stable release" --deep --json
```

Legacy aliases: `search-web`, `browse-page`, `verify-claim`, `evidence-report`.

## When to Use

- facts, versions, releases, dates, or statistics
- recent or time-sensitive questions
- claim checking with citations
- compact evidence reports with citation-ready source digests
- tasks where conflicting sources should be surfaced instead of hidden
- free dual-provider verification with `ddgs + self-hosted searxng`

## Operating Guidance

- Treat `zero-verify` as a first-pass evidence classifier, not a proof engine.
- Prefer `zero-report` when you need a single artifact that combines verdict, citations, and next steps.
- Prefer `zero-search --type news` for recent events.
- Use `zero-browse` when snippets are too thin to justify an answer.
- Cite URLs for factual claims.
- If support and conflict are both present, present the disagreement rather than collapsing it.

## Compatibility Names

- Repository: `zero-api-key-web-search`
- Package: `zero-api-key-web-search`
- Module: `zero_api_key_web_search`
- CLI: `zero-search`, `zero-browse`, `zero-verify`, `zero-report`
- MCP: `zero-mcp`
- Legacy aliases: `search-web`, `browse-page`, `verify-claim`, `evidence-report`, `cross-validated-search-mcp`, `free-web-search-mcp`
- Legacy modules: `free_web_search`, `zero_api_key_web_search_compat`

## Limits

- Default provider diversity is limited because the default path uses `ddgs`.
- The recommended free upgrade path is self-hosted `searxng` via `ZERO_SEARCH_SEARXNG_URL`.
- Scoring is heuristic and depends on returned snippets.
- TLS verification is enabled by default; insecure mode requires an explicit environment variable.
